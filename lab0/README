Included Files in tarball:
-lab0.c (source code in C)
-Makefile
-test (an executable which the makefile uses for the smoke check)
-correct.txt (the correct output of test, which makefile uses for the smoke check)
-README (this file)
-backtrace.png
-breakpoint.png



Smoke Test:
-The smoke test runs a few basic tests to make sure that the source code is at least largely correct.
-To do this, the makefile runs the executable test, which produces specific output for each test.
-The makefile then compares this output to correct.txt, which has the correct output for the executable.

-IMPORTANT: if 'make check' outputs nothing, then the program passes the smoke test.
-If the program doesn't pass the smoke test, 'make check' will produce an error and show the difference between correct and incorrect outputs.

-The tests: ('make check' tests each of these sets of options for lab0)
--no options
-- '--input'
-- '--output'
-- '--segfault'
-- '--catch'
-- '--catch --segfault'



IMPORTANT NOTE: Since the Project Spec doesn't completely specify this, I assume that the --catch 
option DOES NOT automatically cause a segfault. As such, for --catch to do anything, the --segfault
option must also be applied.
However, if I am wrong and --catch should automatically cause and handle a segfault, the change can
be made in my code simply by deleting one character. Namely, one needs to delete a leading comment
symbol which is flagged in my source code.
