# Class_CS111
UCLA Operating Systems class with Dr Reiher.
This is for reference purposes only. If you're currently in Reiher's CS 111 class, I would strongly advise against copying this code.

Every lab that I did in this class is included here, except lab 4a, which didn't include any real programming, and instead just required pictures and information about my particular Beaglebone Green Wireless IOT Developer Kit.

If you're looking for clean code, lab 3b is probably the cleanest I did in the class, largely because we could use python instead of just C.
